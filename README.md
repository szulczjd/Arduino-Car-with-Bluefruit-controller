# Arduino-Car-with-Bluefruit-controller
I built a small 4 wheel drive car using 4 continuous servo's driven by the Arduino Uno.
The car is controlled using the Bluefruit UART module and the Adafruit App on my iphone.
Also the car is equipt with a distance sensor to back up the car if it gets too close to an object.
I utilized a 4 wheel drive scheme as it was easier to impliment than a rear wheel drive and steering mechanism.
